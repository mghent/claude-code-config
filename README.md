### ‚öôÔ∏è settings.json
Configuration file specifying:
- Model selection: `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`

### ü§ñ agents/
Contains custom agent definitions for specialized workflows:

### üìã commands/
Custom command templates for common tasks:

| Command | Description | Usage Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **create-issue** | Creates GitHub issues with review workflow | ‚Ä¢ "Create an issue in mghent/repo: Add dark mode"<br>‚Ä¢ "File a bug report: Login fails on mobile"<br>‚Ä¢ "Create an issue about improving documentation" |

### üìä projects/
Contains session history files (JSONL format) organized by project path. Each file represents a conversation session with Claude Code.

### ‚úÖ todos/
Task management data files tracking todo items across different sessions and projects.

## Features

### GitHub Issue Workflow
A sophisticated GitHub issue creation system that:
1. Creates draft markdown files for review
2. Parses YAML frontmatter for metadata
3. Creates issues via GitHub CLI
4. Manages cleanup after successful creation

### Memory System
Hierarchical memory structure:
- Enterprise policy (system-level)
- Project memory (team-shared)
- User memory (personal preferences)
- Import capability using `@path/to/import` syntax

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
   Requires Node.js 18+

2. **Configure API Key**:
   Set your Anthropic API key in your environment

3. **Customize Settings**:
   Edit `settings.json` to select your preferred model

4. **Add Personal Instructions**:
   Update `CLAUDE.md` with your preferences

## Usage

### Quick Commands
- Use `#` shortcut to quickly add memory files
- Use `/memory` command to edit memory files
- Custom commands can be invoked through natural language

### Available Commands

#### **create-issue** - GitHub Issue Creation
Creates well-structured GitHub issues with a review workflow.

**Natural Language Invocation:**
```
"Create an issue in [repo-name]: [description]"
"File a bug report: [what's wrong]"
"Create an issue about [topic]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Create an issue in mghent/claude-code-config: Add examples for custom agents"
- "File a bug: The settings.json file isn't being loaded correctly"
- "Create an issue about improving the documentation" (will prompt for repo)

**Workflow:**
1. Creates a draft markdown file for your review
2. Allows you to edit before submission
3. Creates the GitHub issue after approval
4. Cleans up temporary files

The agent ensures quality by never skipping the draft review step.

## Best Practices

1. **Memory Management**: Keep CLAUDE.md concise and focused on persistent preferences
2. **Agent Development**: Create specialized agents for complex, repetitive workflows
3. **Command Templates**: Use templates for consistent formatting and structure
4. **Session History**: Projects directory maintains conversation context per project

## Security & Privacy

- All configuration files are stored locally
- Session data remains on your machine
- Enterprise-ready with security features
- No automatic commits without permission (as configured)
